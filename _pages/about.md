Welcome to **Rui Chen**'s academic homepageÔºÅ

I graduated from [China Pharmaceutical University](https://www.cpu.edu.cn/)Ôºåand I am currently working as a pharmaceutical synthesis engineer at [Aidea Pharma](https://aidea.com.cn/)  in Jiangsu, China. 

I specialize in drug design and synthesis , skilled in various CADD applications and other research.

If you are looking for any kind of academic collaboration, please feel free to email me at _chenrui.cpu@gmail.com_.

If you want to know more about me, here is my [CV](/CV.pdf).

**paper**:
- **Rui Chen**, iali Huang, Yumeng Chen, Lian Qin, Xiaofei Li, Haoming Chen, Yuxiao Wang, Zhiyu Li, Yuan Gao, Ahmed R. Ali, Jinlei Bian

**Project**
- Discovery of novel scaffold ASCT2 lead compounds through virtual screening and activity assaying workflows

- Virtual screening workflows such as molecular dynamics simulations, molecular docking, and pharmacophore screening.

- Based on the lead compounds, studied the drug-target conformational relationship, combined with the protein crystal structure, through molecular docking and MD simulation, designed and synthesized 31 novel inhibitors

- By screening for enzyme and cellular activity, obtained inhibitors with tumor cell inhibitory activity superior to positive drug V9302

Li Zhou, Bin Yu, Mengqiu Gao, **Rui Chen**, Zhiyu Li, Yueqing Gu, Jinlei Bian, Yi Ma

**Project**
- The aim of this study was to prepare OP 3D-printed tablets using 3D-printing technology to achieve consistent in vitro release with the reference formulation, as well as to examine the key process parameters during the 3D-printing process.
  
- Dissolution morphology revealed that the 3D printed tablets dissolved mainly in surface dissolution, dissolution at multiple layers and side pore enlargement, which led to faster dissolution release and demonstrated the superiority of the model design.
