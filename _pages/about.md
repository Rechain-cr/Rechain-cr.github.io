Identification of a Novel ASCT2 (SLC1A5) Inhibitor by Dynamic Pharmacophore-Based Virtual Screening (In Submission)

**Rui Chen**, iali Huang, Yumeng Chen, Lian Qin, Xiaofei Li, Haoming Chen, Yuxiao Wang, Zhiyu Li, Yuan Gao, Ahmed R. Ali, Jinlei Bian

**Highlights**
- Discovery of novel scaffold ASCT2 lead compounds through virtual screening and activity assaying workflows.

- Virtual screening workflows such as molecular dynamics simulations, molecular docking, and pharmacophore screening.

- Based on the lead compounds, studied the drug-target conformational relationship, combined with the protein crystal structure, through molecular docking and MD simulation, designed and synthesized 31 novel inhibitors.

- By screening for enzyme and cellular activity, obtained inhibitors with tumor cell inhibitory activity superior to positive drug V9302.
