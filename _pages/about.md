<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Welcome to **Rui Chen**'s academic homepageÔºÅ

I graduated from [China Pharmaceutical University](https://www.cpu.edu.cn/)Ôºåand I am currently working as a pharmaceutical synthesis engineer at [Aidea Pharma](https://aidea.com.cn/)  in Jiangsu, China. 

I specialize in drug design and synthesis , skilled in various CADD applications and other research.

If you are looking for any kind of academic collaboration, please feel free to email me at _chenrui.cpu@gmail.com_.

If you want to know more about me, here is my [CV](/CV.pdf).

Identification of a Novel ASCT2 (SLC1A5) Inhibitor by Dynamic Pharmacophore-Based Virtual Screening (In Submission)

**Rui Chen**, Jiali Huang, Yumeng Chen, Lian Qin, Xiaofei Li, Haoming Chen, Yuxiao Wang, Zhiyu Li, Ahmed R. Ali, Jinlei Bian

**Highlights**
- Discovery of novel scaffold ASCT2 lead compounds through virtual screening and activity assaying workflows

- Virtual screening workflows such as molecular dynamics simulations, molecular docking, and pharmacophore screening

- Based on the lead compounds, studied the drug-target conformational relationship, combined with the protein crystal structure, through molecular docking and MD simulation, designed and synthesized 31 novel inhibitors

- By screening for enzyme and cellular activity, obtained inhibitors with tumor cell inhibitory activity superior to positive drug V9302
