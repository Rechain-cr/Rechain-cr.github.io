Welcome to **Rui Chen**'s academic homepageÔºÅ

I graduated from [China Pharmaceutical University](https://www.cpu.edu.cn/)Ôºåand I am currently working as a pharmaceutical synthesis engineer at [Aidea Pharma](https://aidea.com.cn/)  in Jiangsu, China. 

I specialize in drug design and synthesis , skilled in various CADD applications and other research.

If you are looking for any kind of academic collaboration, please feel free to email me at _chenrui.cpu@gmail.com_.

If you want to know more about me, here is my [CV](/CV.pdf).
